# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

serd: Serd 0.18.2
serd: 
serd: Serd is a lightweight C library for RDF syntax which supports reading
serd: and writing Turtle and NTriples.
serd: Serd is not intended to be a swiss-army knife of RDF syntax, but 
serd: rather is suited to resource limited or performance critical
serd: applications (e.g. converting many gigabytes of NTriples to Turtle),
serd: or situations where a simple reader/writer with minimal dependencies
serd: is ideal (e.g. in LV2 implementations or embedded applications).
